# OCR-tessaract_Textdetection_recognization


 Pytesseract â€“ a Python wrapper for Tesseract. Using this you can easily implement your own text recognizer using Tesseract OCR by writing a simple Python script.
You can download Pytesseract using the pip install pytesseract command.


1) Text Recognization using OpenCV:

The main function in Pytesseract is image_to_text() which takes the image.


2) Text Detection using OpenCV:

Text detection using OpenCV is the classic way of doing things. You can apply various manipulations like image resizing, blurring, thresholding, morphological operations, etc. to clean the image.
